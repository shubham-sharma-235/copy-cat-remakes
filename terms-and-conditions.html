        <h3>DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES; LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>

        <p>
            You expressly agree that your use of, or inability to use, the Service is at your sole risk.

            Under no circumstances will Copycat Remakes, its directors, officers, employees, affiliates, agents, contractors, suppliers, service providers, or licensors be liable for any injury, loss, claim, or any direct, indirect, incidental, punitive, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to lost profits, lost revenue, lost savings, loss of data, or replacement costs, arising from your use of the Service, any products obtained through the Service, or for any other claim related to your use of the Service or any product, including errors or omissions in content, or any loss or damage resulting from content or products posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available via the Service, even if we were advised of the possibility of such damages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such cases, our liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.

        </p>

        <h3>SEVERABILITY</h3>

        <p>
            In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.

        </p>

        <p>
